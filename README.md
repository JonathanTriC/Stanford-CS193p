# Stanford-CS193p
 Stanford CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI) 

---

### Lecture 1
> Getting Started with SwiftUI
>
> The first lecture jumps right into building the first application of the quarter: a card-matching game called Memorize.  It will be the foundation for the first few weeks of course material.

Some points I learned in this lecture:
- Introduction to Xcode
- How to create new SwiftUI project in Xcode
- Introduction to SwiftUI
- SwiftUI view modifiers
- Create some basic view with ZStack
- And more

### Lecture 2
> Learning More about SwiftUI
>
> Development on Memorize continues. Creating reusable components (a Card in the game) and combining them to make more complex user-interfaces.


Some points I learned in this lecture:
- Reuseable components
- Customize preview
- Variables or var, Constant or let, @State modifier
- Build layout using VStack, HStack, LazyVGrid
- Array
- Looping
- Tap gesture
- And more

### Lecture 3
> MVVM
>
> Conceptual overview of the architectural paradigm underlying the development of applications for iOS using SwiftUI (known as MVVM) and an explanation of a fundamental component of understanding the Swift programming language: its type system.  Then both of these are applied to the Memorize application started in the first two lectures.


Some points I learned in this lecture:
- MVVM Design Patterns
- Struct 
- Class
- Protocol
- Generics
- Function
- Init
- Implement MVVM on Memorize project
- And more

### Lecture 4
> More MVVM enum Optionals
>
> The MVVM architecture is fully applied to Memorize.  The important Swift concepts of enums and Optionals are covered and used to finish off the game logic of the Memorize game.


Some points I learned in this lecture:
- Implement MVVM more futher on Memorize Project
- Enum 
- Optional
- Reactive Architecture
- And more

### Lecture 5
> Properties Layout @ViewBuilder
>
> Explore property observers, computed properties, @State and @ViewBuilder.  The mechanisms behind how Views are layed out on screen are examined followed by a demo which chooses a better font for each card in Memorize depending on the space available.  Along the way, apply better access control to Memorize's internal API.

Some points I learned in this lecture:
- Layouting
- Geometry Reader
- Computed Properties
- Extensions
- And more
